# CSSM-502.01
In this term project, I used the same dataset that I have created 2 years ago for an analysis that I have done in R. In CSSM 502 course I wanted to extend my analysis with different methods. In this manner I have employed K-means clustering, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Also I redid the panel regression that I had done in R with plm package, in python with linearmodels package. Results are different and less significant in this project. RDD analysis is done and has given the same results. Mean differences for different groups are same in both analysis. Since the two-way fixed effect estimation is a bit problematic in the calculation of standard errors, and python doesnot have the features/packages for this type of analysis as in R, the difference of the estimations are expected to be resulting from the model specifications.
